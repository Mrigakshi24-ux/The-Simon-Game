# The-Simon-Game
Built a game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery

Machines remember patterns, right? Well so does my game. But can you?

The Simon game works in the sense that it remembers the input that user gives to it at every point. I have build this game using HTML, CSS, Javascript (jQuery). The left side of the webpage contains contains the 4 buttons which can be pressed whereas the right side contains a dropwdown. We can select the maximum number of level upto which we want to play the game. We this program runs, the first thing we have to do it to press any button to start the game. After starting the game, we will have to choose the level. After 2 secs, the first color blinks ( button), and when we click that same button, we got to the next level. In level 2, again a new color blinks, but now we have to press the previous as well as the new button (hence remembering the pattern), so it continues. If we keep on giving the right input after every button click, we advance to new level. If we make a mistake in the pattern, it's Game over. 

I have used jQuery in building up the JS file of my program and it works pretty well :)
